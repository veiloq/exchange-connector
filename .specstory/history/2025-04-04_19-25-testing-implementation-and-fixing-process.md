IMPLEMENT TESTS TEST FIX TILL GREEN

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice your request is quite broad - you'd like me to help implement and fix tests until they pass. However, I'll need more context about what tests we're working with and what codebase we're dealing with. Let me explore what's available.

First, I'll check if there are any test files in the workspace:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `go.mod` |
| 📄 `go.sum` |
| 📁 `test` |
| 📁 `docs` |
| 📄 `DEBUG.md` |
| 📄 `Makefile` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `CHANGELOG.md` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📁 `cmd` |
| 📁 `pkg` |
| 📄 `PROMPT.md` |
| 📄 `sdasd.md` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |

</details>

---

I see this is a Go project with a `test/` directory and a Makefile. Let me check the Makefile first to understand the test commands:

---

Read file: Makefile

---

Let me also check what tests we have:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory test • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `mocks` |
| 📁 `e2e` |
| 📁 `fixtures` |
| 📁 `integration` |

</details>

---

I see this is a Go project with a comprehensive test setup including unit tests, e2e tests, integration tests, and mocks. Let me run the tests to see what's failing:

---

```bash
make test
```

```
go test -v ./...

make: *** [test] Error 1

```

---

I see we have some missing dependencies. Let me fix those first:

---

```bash
go get github.com/avast/retry-go && go get github.com/gorilla/websocket && make deps
```

I see there's an issue with the module path. The code is trying to import from `github.com/veiloq/crypto-exchange-connector` but we're working in a local directory. Let me check the go.mod file:

---

Read file: go.mod

---

Let me check one of the test files to understand what we're dealing with:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory test/e2e • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `bybit_test.go` |

</details>

---

Read file: test/e2e/bybit_test.go

---

I see the issue now. The code is trying to import from `github.com/veiloq/crypto-exchange-connector` but our module is defined as `github.com/bybit`. We need to fix the imports and module structure. Let me check the pkg directory structure:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory pkg • **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `ratelimit` |
| 📁 `exchanges` |
| 📁 `websocket` |
| 📁 `common` |
| 📁 `logging` |

</details>

---

Let me fix the imports in the e2e test file:

---

```diff
  
  	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
- 	"github.com/veiloq/crypto-exchange-connector/pkg/exchanges/bybit"
- 	"github.com/veiloq/crypto-exchange-connector/pkg/exchanges/interfaces"
- 	"github.com/veiloq/crypto-exchange-connector/pkg/logging"
+ 	"github.com/bybit/pkg/exchanges/bybit"
+ 	"github.com/bybit/pkg/exchanges/interfaces"
+ 	"github.com/bybit/pkg/logging"
  )
  
```

---

Now let's try running the tests again:

---

```bash
make test
```

We have a few issues to fix:

1. Missing test dependencies - let's install them first
2. Duplicate declarations in the ratelimit package - we need to fix those

Let's start by installing the test dependencies:

---

```bash
go get -t ./...
```

```
(base) ?➜  bybit 

```

---

Now let's look at the ratelimit package issue. It seems we have duplicate declarations across multiple files:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory pkg/ratelimit • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `rate_limiter.go` |
| 📄 `token_bucket.go` |
| 📄 `limiter.go` |

</details>

---

We have three files with overlapping declarations. Let me check their contents:

---

Read file: pkg/ratelimit/limiter.go

---

Read file: pkg/ratelimit/rate_limiter.go

---

Read file: pkg/ratelimit/token_bucket.go

---

I see the issue. We have three files with overlapping declarations. The `limiter.go` file seems to be the most complete implementation with both token bucket and sliding window algorithms. Let's delete the other two files since they contain duplicate and less complete implementations:

---

Removing duplicate rate limiter implementation.

---

Removing duplicate token bucket implementation.

---

Now let's run the tests again:

_**User**_

use uber ratelimiter dependency if we need that and ready to use dependency

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you switch to Uber's ratelimiter package since it's a well-tested and production-ready solution. Let me make the changes:

1. First, let's install the Uber ratelimiter dependency:

---

```bash
go get go.uber.org/ratelimit
```

```
(base) ➜  bybit go get go.uber.org/ratelimit
go: added github.com/benbjohnson/clock v1.3.0
go: added go.uber.org/ratelimit v0.3.1
(base) ?➜  bybit
```

---

Now let's replace our custom rate limiter with
